I thought a colorfull nmap would do, but then it got into what it is today.

# Requirements:
- Bash (version 4.2 and higher)                                                          ![](https://placehold.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=MUST)
- The APT command                                                                        ![](https://placehold.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=MUST)
- Nmap (obviously)                                                                       ![](https://placehold.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=MUST)
- The GRC command (if you want to use the -v flag)                                      OPTIONAL, BUT GIVES ERROR
- Searchsploit (for looking at vulnerabilities)                                          ![](https://placehold.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=MUST)
- Curl jq package (for looking up the location of an IP address)                         ![](https://placehold.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=MUST)

The program checks if you have them installed, and you can choose to install them.
