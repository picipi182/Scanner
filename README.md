# Scanner
I thought a colorful nmap would do, but then it got into what it is today.

# Requirements:
- Bash (version 4.2 and higher)                                                          **MUST**
- The APT command                                                                        **MUST**
- Nmap (obviously)                                                                       **MUST**
- The GRC command (if you want to use the -v flag)                                      ***OPTIONAL, BUT GIVES ERROR***
- Searchsploit (for looking at vulnerabilities)                                          **MUST**
- Curl jq package (for looking up the location of an IP address)                         **MUST**

The program checks if you have them installed, and you can choose to install them.
