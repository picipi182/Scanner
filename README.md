I thought a colorfull nmap would do, but then it got into what it is today.

# Requirements:
- Bash (version 4.2 and higher)                                                          MUST
- The APT command                                                                        MUST
- Nmap (obviously)                                                                       MUST
- The GRC command (if you want to use the -v flag)                                     OPTIONAL
- Searchsploit (for looking at vulnerabilities)                                          MUST
- Curl jq package (for looking up the location of an IP address)                         MUST

The program checks if you have them installed, and you can choose to install them.
